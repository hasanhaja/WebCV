# WebCV

This project is the fresh re-write of my WebCV from https://github.com/hasanhaja/web-cv.

The primary change has been the migration to TypeScript for development and this will apply to the backend as well.

# Usage

For usage, refer to the [NX_README](NX_README.md) that was generated with this project.
